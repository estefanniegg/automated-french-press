I decided to make my own automated French Press machine. 
To automate it, I used a Raspberry Pi, a Photon (Internet Button), 
two stepper motors, wood, glue, and a lot of imagination.

How it works: when I press the Internet button, it sends a signal to 
the cloud which then sends a signal to the python script running in the 
Raspberry Pi, which controls the coffee machine. When the button is green, 
it means that the machine is ready to start the process. After I press it, 
the timer starts and after 4 mins and the button turns magenta. Then, 
after the timer is done, the Raspberry Pi starts the stepper motors to 
press the French Press and the button turns blue when it is pressing. 
After it is done, the button turns rainbow and plays music to indicate 
that the coffee is ready.
